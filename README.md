## 🧭 Overview

`e2b_dictionary` is a high‑performance, fully automated English‑to‑Bangla dictionary generator.
It crawls webpages, extracts unique English words, retrieves Bangla translations, gathers English definitions, synonyms, and antonyms, and merges everything into a structured JSON database.

The project combines **web scraping, concurrency, linguistic normalization**, and **API‑driven enrichment** to build one of the most comprehensive open‑source bilingual lexicons in Python.

## ✨ Key Features

* ⚡ **Multithreaded processing** – handles thousands of words efficiently
* 🧠 **Smart base‑form detection** – identifies roots like `running → run`, `studies → study`
* 🎨 **Color‑coded logging** via `colorama` for clear runtime feedback
* 🔁 **Automatic dictionary merging** – avoids duplicates and preserves previous data
* 🪶 **GitHub sync fallback** – downloads the latest version if local data is missing
* 🌐 **Hybrid data pipeline** – combines web scraping with open dictionary APIs
* 💬 **Bangla meaning extraction** from publicly available bilingual sources
